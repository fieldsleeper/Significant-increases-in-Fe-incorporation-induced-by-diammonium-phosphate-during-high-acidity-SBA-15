<div class="ltx_p">To measure the impact of DHP additive on Fe incorporation two sets of
samples were prepared. A control group consisting of four samples
ranging across 1:0.017-0.131:0.016:0.364:127
TEOS:Fe2O3:P123:HCl:H2O
were prepared. Additionally, Fe free SBA-15 was prepared under the
identical gel conditions. Table 2 shows that the textural properties and
Fe content are like those for other iron precursors studied.</div>
