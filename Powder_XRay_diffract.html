<div class="ltx_p">Powder X-Ray diffraction analysis was carried out an all samples.
Samples prepared without DHP exhibit no crystalline peaks, while with
DHP crystalline peaks emerge. The only feature present in non-DHP
samples is the broad scattering attributed to amorphous silica often
found centered near 23 °2θ. This feature is also present, superimposed
upon the crystalline peaks in our DHP samples, suggesting that the
materials do contain silica as well. In the case of samples prepared
with DHP in the gel, the peak intensity appears to increase when DHP and
(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2
are introduced at greater quantities, but the same molar ratio. All four
samples contain the (10\(\overset{\overline{}}{2}\)) and (100) of the
DHP samples also contain many of the higher order peaks for
content increases, the position of the peaks move closer to that of
pristine \(\alpha\)-quartz. In addition to the \(\alpha\)-quartz phase,
peaks at 21.05 and 22.75 °2θ appear weakly for 0.50 g DHP and strongly
for 1.00 g DHP samples. We believe these belong to a tridymite like
phase of FePO4
(t-FePO4).8 the presence of
iron phosphate domains prompted us to investigate the P content of the
materials prepared with DHP by ICP. Analysis yielded the following molar
quatities of P (\(\mu\)mol): Fe-SBA-15 (75) 1.1, Fe-SBA-15 (22) 8.1,
Fe-SBA-15 (12) 12.1, Fe-SBA-15 (7) 10.8. These quantites equate to
nFe:nP of approimately 1:1, which is in
agreement with the stoichiometry of \(\alpha\)-FePO4 and
t-FePO4.</div>
