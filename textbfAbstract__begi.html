<div class="ltx_p"><b>Abstract</b></div><div class="ltx_p"><b>Introduction</b></div><div class="ltx_p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA-15, the quintessential acid-catalyzed non-ionic copolymer templated mesoporous silica has served as a support for a variety of earth abundant metals in catalysis, including Al, Ti, V, and Fe (see ref in Y. Li et al. / Microporous and Mesoporous Materials).  In particular Fe-SBA-15 show promise in the upgrading of biomass to Cx-Cy liquid chemicals. (ref here) Since the need for a carbon-neutral surrogate to fossil fuel is still relevant where the scale of energy consumption negates electrification, methods to increase the number of Fe sites within these catalysts is still a worthy pursuit.Unfortunately the acidic nature of SBA-15 synthesis impededs incorporation of high weight percentages of metal.</div><div class="ltx_p">The acid sensitivity of Fe speciation during the preperations of Fe-SBA-15 has prompted researchers to try multi-step methods for production of these catalysts. We believe the need for a facile method using commercial reagents in direct combinations with silica precursor is necessary to provide a solution ( this should address the liquid fuels thing). Here in we explore the direct synthesis of Fe-SBA-15 using diammonium phosphate additive. The impact of salt additives on metal incorporation within SBA-15 was first investigated by budhi et al.1 &nbsp;At this time the effect of the additive, diammonium phosphate ((NH4)2 HPO4, DHP) on metal incorperation has not yet been extended to iron. The preperation of earth abundant catalysts is necessary to provide alternatives to costly Pt or Rh. Diammonium phosphate is a ubiquitous agricultural fertilizer, which gives it an availaability that cmplemments the low cost and abunddance of Fe.&nbsp;Thus we chose to investigae the effects of DHP on Fe incorperation within SBA-15.</div><div class="ltx_p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fe and its carbide are particularly effective catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch process for hydrocarbon synthesis from synthesis gas. With growing domestic supplies of natural gas, catalysts which work with them are necessary. A particular challenge currently is limiting aggregation and particle growth of Fe during the carburization process, which often occurs in situ during industrial scale Fisch-Tropsch processes. We believe one method to limit this process is the sequestration of Fe within the framework of mesoporous silica. We focus on the direct synthesis of these materials, which involve cocontaminant inclusion of Fe precursor while the silica precursor is introduced. Fe was first incorporated within mesoporous silica MFS-9 in 2003 (Yu Han). Since then a variety of techniques to control the pH while Fe was present were investigated, which would mitigate the low high solubility of Fe in acidic media. These early efforts focused on the use of iron nitrate nonahydrate and often employe ammonium fluoride to modulate the pH.&nbsp;</div><div class="ltx_p">Explain how efficient method and further characterization could helpFinally, confinement of the metal species into the silica network drastically reduces metal domain growth by sintering, a principal deactivation route for metal based heterogeneous catalyst.[22-24]</div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Materials and Methods</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Synthesis</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Fe SBA 15</b></div></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Fe PO4 SBA 15</b></div></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>SBA 15</b></div></li></ol></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Characterization</b></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\begin{equation}

conditions we prepared materials from 10 different iron precursors,
including the ubiquitous Ferric (III) Nitrate 9 H2O.
Literature has deemed Fe incorporation into the silica frame work is
controlled by the molar gel ratio of nH2O:nHCl,
prompting us to use 1:0.032:0.016:0.364:127
TEOS:Fe2O3:P123:HCl:H2O.2
As seen in table 1 Regardless of the starting Fe compound, we found
negligible Fe uptake into the final SBA-15. We also believe due to the
high surface area of the final MSN, the presence of Fe precursor in
solution also did not extensively impact the formation mesopporous
silica. We settled on (NH4)2 Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O
ferrous ammonium sulfate due to its compositional similiarty to
ammonium heptamolybdate used in our previous investigation of DHP on
molybdenum incorperation. Once concern was the impact of additional
non-metallic cations or anions on the structure of the final MSN. The
effect of ammonium on MSN ha sbeen investigated by . While the impact of
anions was considered from two points: first, that the presence of
sulfate could impact the state of Fe in solution, and second that the
sulfate anion or phosphate anion could interfere with the</div><div>S+X-I+, where
S+ represents the protonated ethylene oxide groups of
P123, I+ is the protonated variant of silica precursos
under acidic condistions, and X- represents the
coutner anion – usually Cl- from hydrolysis of the
acid catalyst, counterion mediated assemblemy mechanism of SBA-15.
3-5 The second concern relates to the previously
investigated counterion effect on the lyotophic behavior of MSN
formation and we have found no literature reporting on the effect of
phosphate anions specifically on MSN preperation, although SBA-15 has
been prepared using phosphoric acid as opposed to
HCl.6, 7 Since the counterion mediated synthesis
mechanism for SBA-15 involves a sufficient induciton period during which
anions associate with the charged micelle surface, by delaying the
addition of sulfate or phosphate species until after the induction
period, we avoided any deleterious effects on the structure of the
resulting MSN. At the end of the induction period, the region between
micelles is still relativley unpopulated with condesed silica species
leaving ample oportunity for metal incorperation</div></div></blockquote></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div></div>
