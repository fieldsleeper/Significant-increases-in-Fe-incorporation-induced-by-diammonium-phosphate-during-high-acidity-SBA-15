<div class="ltx_p"><b>Abstract</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Introduction</b></div><div class="ltx_p">The SBA 15 family of mesoporous silica has served as a vehicle for a
variety of earth abundant metal sites in catalysis. However, the
acidic nature of the synthesis makes incorporation of large quantities
of metal difficult. Fe-SBA-15 catalysts have shown sensitivity to the
acidic medium, prompting researchers to try exotic methods for
production of these catalysts. We believe the need for a facile method
using commercial reagents is necessary to drive the formation of
future mesopporous materials. Here we explore the direct synthesis of
Fe-SBA-15 using diammonium phosphate additive.</div></li><li><div class="ltx_p"></div></li></ol><div class="ltx_p"></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Materials and Methods</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Synthesis</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Fe SBA 15</b></div></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Fe PO4 SBA 15</b></div></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>SBA 15</b></div></li></ol></li><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Characterization</b></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\begin{equation}

conditions we prepared materials from 10 different iron precursors,
including the ubiquitous Ferric (III) Nitrate 9 H2O.
Literature has deemed Fe incorporation into the silica frame work is
controlled by the molar gel ratio of nH2O:nHCl,
prompting us to use 1:0.032:0.016:0.364:127
TEOS:Fe2O3:P123:HCl:H2O.2
As seen in table 1 Regardless of the starting Fe compound, we found
negligible Fe uptake into the final SBA-15. We also believe due to the
high surface area of the final MSN, the presence of Fe precursor in
solution also did not extensively impact the formation mesopporous
silica. We settled on (NH4)2 Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O
ferrous ammonium sulfate due to its compositional similiarty to
ammonium heptamolybdate used in our previous investigation of DHP on
molybdenum incorperation. Once concern was the impact of additional
non-metallic cations or anions on the structure of the final MSN. The
effect of ammonium on MSN ha sbeen investigated by . While the impact of
anions was considered from two points: first, that the presence of
sulfate could impact the state of Fe in solution, and second that the
sulfate anion or phosphate anion could interfere with the</div><div>S+X-I+, where
S+ represents the protonated ethylene oxide groups of
P123, I+ is the protonated variant of silica precursos
under acidic condistions, and X- represents the
coutner anion – usually Cl- from hydrolysis of the
acid catalyst, counterion mediated assemblemy mechanism of SBA-15.
3-5 The second concern relates to the previously
investigated counterion effect on the lyotophic behavior of MSN
formation and we have found no literature reporting on the effect of
phosphate anions specifically on MSN preperation, although SBA-15 has
been prepared using phosphoric acid as opposed to
HCl.6, 7 Since the counterion mediated synthesis
mechanism for SBA-15 involves a sufficient induciton period during which
anions associate with the charged micelle surface, by delaying the
addition of sulfate or phosphate species until after the induction
period, we avoided any deleterious effects on the structure of the
resulting MSN. At the end of the induction period, the region between
micelles is still relativley unpopulated with condesed silica species
leaving ample oportunity for metal incorperation</div></div></blockquote></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div></div>
