<div class="ltx_p"><b>Abstract</b></div><div class="ltx_p"><b>Introduction</b></div><div class="ltx_p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA-15, the quintessential acid-catalyzed non-ionic-copolymer-templated mesoporous silica has served as a support for a variety of earth abundant metals in catalysis, including Al, Ti, V, and Fe (see ref in Y. Li et al. / Microporous and Mesoporous Materials).  In particular Fe-SBA-15 shows promise in the upgrading of biomass to Cx-Cy liquid chemicals. (ref here) Iron and its carbide are particularly effective catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch process for hydrocarbon synthesis. (<b>references</b>?) With growing domestic supplies of natural gas, catalysts which utilize this abundant resource could assitst in the bridge between petroleum derived fuels and biomass sourced alternatives.&nbsp;A current challenge in Fischer-Tropsch catalyis is limiting aggregation and particle growth of Fe during the carburization process, which often occurs in situ during industrial scale Fisch-Tropsch processes. (<b>references</b>) We believe one method to limit this process is the sequestration of Fe within the framework of mesoporous silica. We focus on the direct synthesis of these materials, which involve cocontaminant inclusion of Fe precursor while the silica precursor is introduced.&nbsp;</div><div class="ltx_p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the need for a carbon-neutral surrogate to fossil fuel is still relevant where the scale of energy consumption negates electrification, methods to increase the number of Fe sites within these catalysts is  a worthy pursuit. Unfortunately the acidic nature of SBA-15 synthesis impedes incorporation of high weight percentages of metal. With the highly acidic (pH &lt; 1) aqueous media used for the preperation of SBA-15,  Fe exisits nearly exclusiley as solvated Fe<sup>2+&nbsp;</sup>Ions. Additonaly, lack of flanking oxygens as in oxo-metal species, prevent nucleophilic attack on silanol species minimizing direct incopreation of Fe within the silica framework.&nbsp;The acid sensitivity of Fe speciation during the preperation of Fe-SBA-15 has prompted researchers to implement multi-step methods as opposed to "direct-synthesis" in which the metal precursor is added directly to the sythesis media in conjuction with silica precursor. &nbsp;(<b>ref</b>)&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>For example, &nbsp;iron was first incorporated within mesoporous silica under highly acidic conditions by preperation of Fe zeolites which were cocondensed within forming MSN. Early reports of Fe-SBA 15, by "direct" synthesis often focused on the application of the end-material, with minimal emphasis on Fe incorperation itself. (x wang 2005 x2) Since then a variety of techniques to control the pH while iron is present, which would mitigate the  high solubility of Fe in acidic media have been investigated. (ref) Eventually  understanding of the effect of Fe/Si ratio was explored from pH 1-6, relativley weak conditions. (ying li 2005) By varying Fe/Si from 1-15 within the gel, Fe/Si within the product spanned 0.043 - 7.41 at pH = 1.5. Further, by setting the gel at conditions which yield Fe/Si = 0.072 and varying pH from 1-5.6, Fe/Si in the product ranged from 0-1. The structure of Fe in these materials often exists as isolated framework species at low Fe/Si ratio, with a distribution of extraframe work clusters, iron oxides, and framework species appearing at high Fe/Si.&nbsp;Many of these early efforts focused on the use of iron nitrate nonahydrate, opperate in weak-acid, or  employ ammonium fluoride to modulate the pH. &nbsp;However, Vinu et al expanded our understanding of the role of x to x ration as a method to surmount of negativley charged silica species and posiitive iron hydroxo compounds under highly acidic conditions used during SBA-15 synthesis. Extrapolating from their previous work towards optimization of Al incorperation within SBA-15, illustrates the role pH plays. High acid content promots formation of aqueous Fe<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;while silanol species also posses apositive charge. The positivley charged silanol units effectivley coordinate with negativley charged ethylene oxide regions of the polymer template, however electrostatic repulsion drives away aqueous metal species. By adjusting the pH above the isoeletric point of silica, a negative charge is developed which iteracts favorably with dissolved metals. (A vinu 2004)</div><div class="ltx_p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite effective Fe incorperation by pH tuning, other strategies like alternative precursors or  co-reactants have not been studied. The majority of the aformentioned materials are prepared from iron nitrate nonahydrate, while a few reports make use of ferric chloride, Fenton's reagent, and ferric oxalate. (ying li 2005,van grieken 2009, khieu dinh/Phu Nguyen 2007, Yon-Mei Liu 2008) The lack of diversity in pecursors justifies a comparative investigation of the effects of  precursor on incorporation.&nbsp;In addition, iron content still remains relativley low for direct synthetic methods, with maximum Fe/Si ratios after calcinationof 0.1 and the majority of reports ranging from 47 to 13 (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	 	 	 	 	 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	 	 		ying li 2005xq wang 2004a vinu 2005Yon-Mei Liu 2008Bachari 2009van grieken 2009h yan 2016). Here in we explore the direct synthesis of Fe SBA-15 using diammonium phosphate ((NH4)2 HPO4, DHP) additive as an alternative to adjustment of pH. The impact of salt additives on metal incorporation within SBA-15 was first investigated by Budhi et al however &nbsp;at this time the effect of salt&nbsp; additive on metal incorperation has not yet been extended to iron. Additon of DHP drastically increases Fe content under the native high acidity of SBA-15 synthesis while preserving high dispersion of metal sites necessary for a sinter reisstant catalyst. We explore the structure of these materials through XRD, SAXRD, 57Fe mossbauer spectroscopy, and EDAX mapping. Experimental results are combined with complex equilibrium calcualtiosn to propose a mechanism of the interaction between iron and dhp leading to increased loading.&nbsp;</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Materials and Methods</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Synthesis</b></div><ol><li><div class="ltx_p"><b>Fe SBA 15</b></div><div>All materials prepared vary from a main SBA-15 synthetic recipie.

conditions we prepared materials from 10 different iron precursors,
including the ubiquitous Ferric (III) Nitrate 9 H2O.
Literature has deemed Fe incorporation into the silica frame work is
controlled by the molar gel ratio of nH2O:nHCl,
prompting us to use 1:0.032:0.016:0.364:127
TEOS:Fe2O3:P123:HCl:H2O.2
As seen in table 1 Regardless of the starting Fe compound, we found
negligible Fe uptake into the final SBA-15. We also believe due to the
high surface area of the final MSN, the presence of Fe precursor in
solution also did not extensively impact the formation mesopporous
silica. We settled on (NH4)2 Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O
ferrous ammonium sulfate due to its compositional similiarty to
ammonium heptamolybdate used in our previous investigation of DHP on
molybdenum incorperation. Once concern was the impact of additional
non-metallic cations or anions on the structure of the final MSN. The
effect of ammonium on MSN ha sbeen investigated by . While the impact of
anions was considered from two points: first, that the presence of
sulfate could impact the state of Fe in solution, and second that the
sulfate anion or phosphate anion could interfere with the</div><div>S+X-I+, where
S+ represents the protonated ethylene oxide groups of
P123, I+ is the protonated variant of silica precursos
under acidic condistions, and X- represents the
coutner anion – usually Cl- from hydrolysis of the
acid catalyst, counterion mediated assemblemy mechanism of SBA-15.
3-5 The second concern relates to the previously
investigated counterion effect on the lyotophic behavior of MSN
formation and we have found no literature reporting on the effect of
phosphate anions specifically on MSN preperation, although SBA-15 has
been prepared using phosphoric acid as opposed to
HCl.6, 7 Since the counterion mediated synthesis
mechanism for SBA-15 involves a sufficient induciton period during which
anions associate with the charged micelle surface, by delaying the
addition of sulfate or phosphate species until after the induction
period, we avoided any deleterious effects on the structure of the
resulting MSN. At the end of the induction period, the region between
micelles is still relativley unpopulated with condesed silica species
leaving ample oportunity for metal incorperation</div></div></blockquote></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div></div>
