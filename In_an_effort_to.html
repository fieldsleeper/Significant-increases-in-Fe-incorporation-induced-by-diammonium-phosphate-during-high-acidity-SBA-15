<div class="ltx_p">In an effort to better understand the oreintation and interaction of Fe,
P, and Si EDS mapping, Figure g, was recorded. In general all materials
show uniform distribution of Fe, P, and Si. At this scale, the
morphology of the Fe-SBA-15 can be observed. Samples with high Fe
content, x-C and x-D display the archetypical ropelike particle
silhouette. Samples low in Fe, A and B, tend to consist of particles
shaped as random polygons. Each sample shows Fe and P correlated
directly to Si reinforcing our claim that iron phosphate domain present
exist within the SBA-15 framework. All samples exhibit more intense P
spectr in comparison to Fe. Additionaly, Fe spectrum intensity increases
from A to D mirroring the trend observed by ICP-AES. Likewise, an
expected direct correlation between the sharpness and intensity of iron
phosphate phases observed in XRD and increasing Fe and P content is
displayed. The Fe content caluculated from EDS disagrees with that of
ICP, however EDS is a surface sensitive technique, indicating that the
surface of the Fe-SBA-15 prepared is Fe difficient.</div>
