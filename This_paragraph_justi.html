<div class="ltx_p">This paragraph justifies Fe-P interaction</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Since there does not appear to be mechanistic grounds for interaction
between Si and Fe or Si and P, we believe that the interaction of Fe and
P species in solution is responsible for the remarkable uptake of Fe
within the prepared SBA-15. The interaction of Fe and P species in
acidic media has been studied and based on both spectrophotmetric and
potentiometric data, the concnetration of
[FeHnPOn+4 ]
species ranges from 100 to 10000 times higher than the
[Fe3+][H3PO4]
for pH ranging from 1 to 2 , suggesting iron phosphates can readily form
under our synthesic conditiosn.17 Pre-calcination XRD
patterns in figure t, acquired after filtration and washing show complex
behaviour reminiscient of a variety of hydrated iron phosphates and
minerals. While an exact identification by XRD was not possible, there
is a clear trend of \(\alpha\) or tridimyte iron phosphates diffracting
above 20Â° while hydrates exhibit additional peaks below. This is likely
due to the much larger unit cell dimensions necessary to accommodate
water of crystalization, and hence greater interplanar spacings.</div>
