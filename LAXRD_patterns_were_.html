<div class="ltx_p">LAXRD patterns were recorded for each control sample to probe if the
presence of Fe in the gel impeded mesophase formation. Each sample shows
characteristic (10), (11), and (20) diffraction peaks of p6mm space
group. The presence of (11) and (20) reflections in Fig. k indicates
well defined extended pore structure. XRD from 10-80 ° 2θ (S1)
did not show diffraction peaks for any of the common phases of iron or
iron oxide.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Investigation of the morphology of SBA-15 prepared in the presence of
(NH4)2 Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O by TEM
shown in Fig. x hexagonal array of pores. No Fe particles appear to be
present, suggesting that the precursor predominately remains
unincorperated within MSN.</div>
