<div class="ltx_p">Including additional DHP at DHP:Fe stoichiometries above 1 continually
improves the textural properties towards that of native SBA-15. The
stoichiometry of Fe:P remains 1:1 even at nP:nFe 5.4:1 in the gel. This
suggests a single Fe-P intermediate may be present during synthesis as
suggested by our complex equilibria calculations.</div>
