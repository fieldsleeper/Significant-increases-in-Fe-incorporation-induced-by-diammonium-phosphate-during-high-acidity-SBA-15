</ol>


<div class="ltx_p">A range of samples were prepared in the presence of DHP in order to
expose the effects and mechanism of the salt on Fe-SBA-15 formation.
Samples synthesized in the presence of DHP used the same gel ratio as
additive free controls in table 1. For each sample, prepared,
approximately equimolar quantity of DHP to nFe was
added. Beyond these samples, asymmetric samples were prepared with
5.4:1, 2.7:1. 0.66:1, 0.33:1 nDHP:
n(NH4)2 Fe (SO4)2 (Fig x).</div>
