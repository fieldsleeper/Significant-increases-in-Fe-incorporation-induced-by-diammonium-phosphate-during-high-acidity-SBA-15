<div class="ltx_p">The morphology and composition of Fe-SBA-15 was initialy determined
using ICP-AES, N2 physisorption, and LAXRD; summarized
in table 3. All materials prepared show drastic decrease in
nSi/nFe while exhibiting high surface
area. In the presence of DHP we observe between a 100 and 100,000 %
improvement of Fe incorporation into the final catalyst.</div>
