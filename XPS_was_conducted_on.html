<div class="ltx_p">XPS was conducted on both DHP and non-DHP samples, both Fe and P were
analyzed. The Fe 2 p3/2 spectrum exhibited noise due to
the low Fe content of the samples. All samples prepared showed 2:1
stoichiometry for O 1s to Si. 2p. Non-DHP samples showed 0 at. % Fe
except for Fe SBA-15 (168) which possessed 0.1 at. % Fe. All samples
synthesized with equimolar DHP had an elevated Fe signal as well as the
presence of P. Fe content measured 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3 at. % for
samples FePO4 SBA-15 (75), FePO4 SBA-15
(22), FePO4 SBA-15 (12), and FePO4
SBA-15 (7) respectively. P content was steady at 1:1 to Fe at. %.
Figure x. shows a trend in binding energy shift observed for sample
prepared with DHP. As P and Fe at. % increases, the P 2p binding energy
decreases from 133.8 eV for FePO4 SBA-15 (75) to 132.8
eV for FePO4 SBA-15 (7).</div>
