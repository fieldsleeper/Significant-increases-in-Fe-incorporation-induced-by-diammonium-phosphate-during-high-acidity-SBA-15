<div class="ltx_p">N2 physisorption measurments were carried out upon four
samples of SBA-15 synthesized with increasing amouns of
(NH4)2 Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O. All four
samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a H1 hysterisis loop between the
adsorption and desorption branches. However, Fe-SBA-15 (169) begins to
exhibit pseudo H2 behavior due to the less defined onset of capillary
condensation in the adsorption branch. Fe-SBA-15 (168), Fe-SBA-15
(1425), and Fe-SBA-15 (1669) share similar plateau pressures, which is
reflected in their similar pore volumes. Fe-SBA-15 (999) exhibits a 36
preaperd with (NH4) Fe
(SO4)2 6 H2O and was
only 21 % below that of SBA-15 control. The remainder of the samples
showed VP at lest 77 % below that of the control.
Tabulated values for textural properties an be found in table 2.</div>
